    text: "The basic idea was to find a balance between the thin, wispy sans-serif used to indicate a ‘futuristic‘ tone, and a bold, masculine font synonymous with ‘construction‘. We came up with something in the middle, leaning towards lighter-weighted fonts, but still with a hint of that blocky ‘construction’ vibe. We use Chaney for general display and when we want to drive attention to the content, and the technical and geometric Sora font for the body copy and paste overall hierachy."

Further pages. This positioning was also considered when defining the color palette. Smoky Black represents trust and confidence while vividly contrasting against light backgrounds, whereas purple represents innovation."
